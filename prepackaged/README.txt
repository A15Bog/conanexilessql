READ THIS FIRST - THESE MAKE RUNNING SCRIPTS AS EASY AS CLICKING A .BAT FILE

Each directory contains a set of prepacked scripts to execute against your game database.
Open the directory containg the scripts you want to run.
Download both files from any directory here to a local directory that contains your game.db file.
Backup a good copy of your game.db to a different directory.
Run the .bat file to execute the commands.

The EVERYREBOOT script contains the ReportsOnly, FixStuckPlayers, and RemoveNoOwnership, 7 Day Decay combined together.

Notes: The batch file will execute against any game*.db file in the directory you run it against.
Meaning if you have a game_backup_1.db file, they will also run against that.
Make sure you put your backup in a seraprate directory so the scripts dont run against it.


WHEN THESE SCRIPTS RUN SUCESSFULLY, THIS IS WHAT THE WINDOW WILL SHOW:

"game.db"
ok
Press any key to continue...

Then press any key and the window will disappear. You are then OK to re-upload your db file to the server.
