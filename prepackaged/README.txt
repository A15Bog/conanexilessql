READ THIS FIRST - THESE MAKE RUNNING SCRIPTS AS EASY AS CLICKING A .BAT FILE

Each directory contains a set of prepacked scripts to execute against your game database.
Open the directory containg the scripts you want to run.
Download both files from any directory here to a local directory that contains your game.db file.
Backup a good copy of your game.db to a different directory.
Run the .bat file to execute the commands. If it works, the window will show:
"game.db"
Press any key to continue...

Notes: The batch file will execute against any game*.db file in the directory you run it against.
Meaning if you have a game_backup_1.db file, they will also run against that.
Make sure you put your backup in a seraprate directory so the scripts dont run against it.
