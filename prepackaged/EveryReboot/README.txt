This file I run every single reboot. I stop my server, download the game.db into a directory with these files, run the EveryReboot.bat file.

1. 7 Day Decay(only removes guilds if all members have not been active in 7 days)

3. Fix exiled players
4. Database maintenance
5. Reports
	a. Buildings per owner
