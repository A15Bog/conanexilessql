--THIS IS A FIX FOR LOGGING SO YOU DON'T GET SO MUCH JUNK. IT MAKES SURE ERRORS ARE LOGGED ALONG WITH NORMAL LOGGING OF IPs, CHAT, DEATHS
--Replace the Core.Log section in BaseEngine.ini with this, or add to Engine.ini to make sure it persists:

[Core.Log]
global=error
ChatWindow=log
BattlEyeLogging=log
Building=log
ConanSandbox=log
HeatmapMetrics=log
Login=log
LogNet=log
